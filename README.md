Our intent is to look for demographic trends in the population of National Basketball Association players over the history of the league.  Kaggle has a data set of all the NBA players which includes where they are from.  We would like to compare this to US and world economic data to try to find out who the cohort of NBA players represents in the wider population.  Additional factors to consider might be the prevalence of violence and crime as well as the mortality rate and life expectancy of their birth region.  

Through this we hope to see if there's perhaps several populations represented among elite bastketball players, if the trend correlates to economic factors and if that correlation is repeated in the NBA's foreign born population.

Ultimately our project will feature interactive comparisons between the various data sets, maps which track where NBA players come from and how that has changed over time and attempt to draw wider conclusions about the economic and demographic factors which lead an individual to develop into an elite caliber basketball player.
